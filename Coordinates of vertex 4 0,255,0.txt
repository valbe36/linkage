perfect.Now, let us make a script to create the joints for SeatY. we need to search for the points where it intersects ChordLower and ChordUpper. 

Npw, let us make a sketch to create SeatH. SeatH part is wire 3d deformable, mesh 0.12. It is composed by 5 parallel, disjointed wires of equal length. each wire is 0.704 long along z and the offset is 0.54 along x. the first and last wire have cross section "RHS_60x5x2e5". the middle wires have cross section "RHS_40x25x2e5". these cross sections are already in the assembly. since they are rectangular cross sections, we need to ensure proper orientation. try one and i tell you if changes are needed. Instances: the part follows the very same pattern as SeatY.

Let us make the load cases. Load Case "Ultimate". we apply
